# HTMLUtils

This is a generic JavaScript/security library for HTML Encoding strings and objects. It will recursively walk a given JSON object, and encode anything necessary, all children, children of children, objects, lists, etc. 

Similarly, the decoding functions will recursively HTML Decode anything necessary in a provided string/JSON object. 

Use it by calling HTMLUtils.HTMLEncodeJSONObject(myObject);

Any problems/feedback/pull requests are always welcome.
